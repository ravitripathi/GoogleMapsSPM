# GoogleMapsSPM
Repo containing a Package.swift for Google Maps SDK

This repo publishes a release mirroring the contents of "https://dl.google.com/geosdk/GoogleMaps-6.2.1-beta.tar.gz". The individual frameworks hosted on this link have been seperated out into seperated compressed frameworks, allowing them to be added as binary targets in `Package.swift`
